   to the fix; the remaining [m-j-1] outer params stay as closure
   variables for the lifted top-level definition.

   Soundness relies on [leftover] not free-referencing the dropped
   binders; this is true for the [tFix] uses we target (the fix's
   body uses the *closure* outer params, not the η-stripped ones),
   but is not checked here. *)
