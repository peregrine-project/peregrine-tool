(** * Common-subexpression elimination / let-introduction for lambda-box

    This middle-end pass hoists a repeated closed subterm of a constant body
    into a single outermost [tLetIn] and replaces its occurrences by a bound
    variable, so a value that the source shared but erasure duplicated is
    computed once at run time.  Wellformedness preservation and the algebraic
    core of the transform are proved; whole-program evaluation preservation
    rests on one axiom ([cse_pres_eval]).

    Motivation.  Several Peregrine frontends do not preserve [let] bindings:
    Agda inlines its internal let-bindings before erasure, and Lean drops them
    entirely.  A subterm that the source shared through a [let] is therefore
    duplicated in the erased lambda-box term and, under the call-by-value
    semantics of the backends, recomputed once per occurrence at run time.  A
    middle-end CSE pass reverses this for every frontend at once: it hoists a
    repeated subterm into a single [tLetIn] and replaces its occurrences by a
    bound variable, so the work is performed once.

    Why sharing is sound in lambda-box.  Lambda-box is pure (erasure has
    discarded proofs and types; there are no observable effects), so sharing a
    subterm never changes the result.  Under the backends' call-by-value
    evaluation a [tLetIn] forces its bindee exactly once before the body runs,
    which is precisely the sharing wanted.  Sharing does not change strictness
    provided the hoisted subterm already runs on every path: the pass hoists
    only a manifest subterm that the original program evaluates on every
    occurrence, so pulling it out to a [let] that runs once can only remove
    work, never add it, and never moves a diverging computation to a point the
    program did not already demand.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALGORITHM.

    Scope.  The pass runs per constant body.  Constant bodies in a lambda-box
    global environment are closed (no dangling [tRel]).  The pass exploits this:
    it hoists only a subterm [s] that is itself closed ([closedn 0 s]).  A
    closed subterm is invariant under [lift], is identical wherever it appears
    regardless of the number of enclosing binders, and can be substituted by a
    de-Bruijn index that points at a freshly-introduced outermost [let] binder.
    The transform is therefore correct-by-construction with no index arithmetic
    beyond counting the binders descended under.

    Steps, for a closed constant body [t]:
      1. Collect the multiset of all subterms of [t] (fuel-bounded traversal).
      2. Keep the candidates: subterms that are [closedn 0], whose structural
         [size] is at least [cse_threshold] (small subterms are not worth a
         binder, and hoisting a bare [tRel]/[tConst] would be pointless), and
         all of whose occurrences are in strict (always-evaluated) positions.
      3. Keep those occurring at least [cse_min_occ] (= 2) times.
      4. Score each surviving candidate by its estimated dynamic saving,
         [(occurrences - 1) * size], and pick the maximum.
      5. Emit  [tLetIn "cse" best (abstract 0 best t)]  where [abstract k s u]
         replaces every occurrence of [s] in [u] by [tRel k], incrementing [k]
         under each binder so the index always resolves to the outer [let].

    This performs one hoist per constant, capturing the largest repeated
    subterm.  Possible extensions, none of which the pass performs:
      - Hoisting open subterms whose free [tRel]s are all bound above the
        nearest common ancestor of the occurrences, lifted to that ancestor
        with a [lift]; this needs nearest-common-binder-scope analysis.
      - Iterating to a fixpoint and hoisting several candidates simultaneously.
      - Descending into [tPrim] array payloads (treated as a leaf here).

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PIPELINE PLACEMENT AND VERIFICATION STATUS.

    CSE is the inverse of inlining/beta, so ordering matters: it must run after
    [EInlining]/[EBeta]/dearg, near the end of the unsafe tail, otherwise a
    later beta/inline pass would undo it.  The intended slot is inside
    [extra_unsafe_transforms] in erasure/Transforms.v, after
    [specialize_instances]/[betared]; [implement_box] creates no sharing
    opportunities, so either side of it is fine, and placing CSE last keeps it
    closest to code generation.  It is a [Compatible]-class, opt-in optional
    phase, wired like [EInstanceSpecialize]/[EBeta].

    Verification status: wellformedness preservation and the algebraic core are
    proved; whole-program evaluation preservation rests on one axiom.

      - The core algebraic fact is proved: [abstract_subst] shows that for a
        closed [s], [subst [s] k (abstract s k t) = t] whenever [closedn k t] --
        binding [s] and substituting it back reconstructs [t].

      - Wellformedness preservation ([cse_wf]) is fully proved: the pass is
        guarded to fire only when [has_tLetIn] and [has_tRel] hold (otherwise it
        is the identity), the hoisted [s] is a closed, non-lambda subterm of a
        wellformed body hence itself wellformed ([collect_wf],
        [wellformed_closedn_le]), [abstract] preserves wellformedness
        ([wellformed_abstract]), and [wellformed] is invariant under the
        constant-body environment rewrite ([wellformed_cse_env]).
        [Print Assumptions cse_wf] reports no custom axioms.

      - Both [TransformExt] obligations are proved ([extends_cse]).

      - Soundness depends on hoisting only subterms evaluated on every path.
        [candidate_ok] requires every occurrence of the candidate to be in a
        strict (always-evaluated) position
        ([count_term u all_strict = count_term u all_full], via
        [collect_strict]).  This prevents lifting a subterm out of a [tLambda]
        body or an untaken [tCase] branch and forcing it eagerly, which would
        change termination.

      - Evaluation preservation ([cse_pres]) uses the observational relation
        [v' = v]: a sharing pass returns the same value.  It reduces to one
        axiom, [cse_pres_eval], the whole-program CBV simulation, which holds
        for the strict-guarded selection.  Its algebraic backbone
        [abstract_subst] is proved; the remaining cross-environment induction
        over the [EWcbvEval] rules is the sole non-primitive axiom
        [cse_transformation] depends on.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PIPELINE INTEGRATION.  Enabling the pass requires the following wiring,
    mirroring EInstanceSpecialize.v:

      1. _CoqProject: add the line
             theories/erasure/ECommonSubexpr.v
         (after theories/erasure/EInstanceSpecialize.v).

      2. theories/Config.v:
         - add field  [cse_c : phases_config]  to record [erasure_phases_config];
         - add field  [cse : bool]             to record [erasure_phases].

      3. theories/ConfigUtils.v:
         - add  [cse' : option bool]  to [erasure_phases'] and set it to [None]
           in [empty_erasure_phases'];
         - add the corresponding line to [get_default_phases_opt]
             ([cse := get_default_phase_opt' o cse_c]) and to [enforce_phases]
             ([cse := enforce_phase' o.(cse') d.(cse) o'.(cse_c)]).

      4. The 8 backend default configs (theories/backends/*.v):
         RustBackend, ElmBackend, CBackend, WasmBackend, OCamlBackend,
         CakeMLBackend, EvalBackend, ASTBackend — add
             cse_c := Compatible false;
         to each [erasure_phases_config] literal (opt-in, off by default).

      5. Serialization (theories/serialization/):
         - SerializeConfig.v: add  [to_sexp (cse o)]  to
           [Serialize_erasure_phases] and  [to_sexp (cse' o)]  to
           [Serialize_erasure_phases'];
         - DeserializeConfig.v: bump both [erasure_phases] deserializers from
           [Deser.con8_ Build_erasure_phases(')] to [Deser.con9_ ...].

      6. theories/erasure/Transforms.v:
         - [From Peregrine Require Import ECommonSubexpr.];
         - thread a [cse : bool] parameter through [extra_unsafe_transforms],
           [untyped_transform_pipeline] and [typed_..._pipeline], adding
             ETransform.optional_self_transform cse
               (cse_transformation efl EImplementBox.block_wcbv_flags)
           to the [▷] chain (last, after specialize/box), and discharge the
           extra [destruct cse] cases in the obligations exactly as the existing
           [spec_inst]/[impl_box]/[impl_lazy_force] cases are discharged.

      7. theories/Pipeline.v:
         - read  [let do_cse := c.(erasure_opts).(cse) in]  in [apply_transforms]
           and pass [do_cse] into the [run_*_transforms] calls (alongside
           [spec_inst], [impl_box], [impl_lazy]).

      8. bin/ CLI (bin/*.ml): expose a [--cse] flag setting [cse'] to [Some true]
           (optional; the config default already governs behaviour).

(** ** (3) SEMANTICS PRESERVATION.

    CORRECTNESS MODEL.

    The observational relation for a sharing pass is the identity on values,
    [v' = v]: hoisting a closed subterm evaluated on every path, forcing it once
    in an outer [let], and substituting its value back yields the same value.
    (The congruence-style obseq [v' = cse_term v] used by [EBeta] does not apply
    here: [cse_term] performs one global hoist, so it is not a congruence and
    does not commute with evaluation — for a value with a repeated closed
    subterm, [cse_term v] is a [tLetIn], which cannot evaluate to itself.)  The
    algebraic backbone is proved: [abstract_subst] gives
    [subst0 s (abstract s 0 t) = t] for closed [s]; under [eval_zeta] the [let]
    forces [s] to [s'] and [csubst]s it back, and [closed_subst] turns that
    [csubst] into the [subst] of [abstract_subst].

    SOUNDNESS DISCRIMINATOR.  Hoisting is sound only for subterms evaluated on
    every path.  [candidate_ok] enforces this: a candidate must have all its
    occurrences in strict (always-evaluated) positions
    ([count_term u all_strict = count_term u all_full]).  Without this guard the
    pass would be unsound — it could lift a subterm out of a [tLambda] body or
    an untaken [tCase] branch and force it eagerly, changing termination.

    [cse_pres_eval] below is the single residual: the whole-program CBV
    simulation with the [v' = v] conclusion.  It holds for the strict-guarded
    selection above; the outstanding work is the cross-environment induction
    over the [EWcbvEval] rules (relating eval under [Σ] and under [cse_env Σ],
    threading the strict-position hoist), comparable in size to MetaRocq's
    [EBeta]/[Optimize] evaluation-preservation developments and stated as an
    explicit axiom in the manner of [EBeta.trust_betared_pres]. *)
