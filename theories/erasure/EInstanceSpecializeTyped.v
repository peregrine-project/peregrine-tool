(** * Instance / dictionary specialization on TYPED lambda-box (λ□ᵀ / ExAst)

    This module is the typed variant of the instance-specialization pass, a
    self-contained sibling of the untyped [EInstanceSpecialize.v] that does not
    import it.  It operates on MetaRocq's *typed* erased syntax
    ([MetaRocq.Erasure.Typed.ExAst]) — the layer that still carries [box_type]
    information ([cst_type]) — which is where the pass belongs in the Peregrine
    pipeline: it runs before the Rust / Elm backends, where the dictionary
    plumbing it removes is not re-optimized away by a downstream native
    compiler (unlike the OCaml / C paths).

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT THE PASS DOES (identical algorithm to the untyped module, lifted to
    ExAst so [box_type]s are tracked).

    At a call [f D x1 .. xn] where the head [f] is a [tConst] (its body may be
    a [tFix], unfolded once) and [D] is a *statically-known dictionary* — a
    closed [tConstruct] whose inductive is a single-constructor record, or a
    [tConst] delta-unfolding to one — the pass:

      1. emit a fresh specialized constant [f$specN] whose body is [f]'s body
         with [D] substituted in ([spec_beta]) and the exposed method
         projections collapsed by the local beta/iota reducer
         ([specialize_instances]);
      2. give [f$specN] a [cst_type]: the callee's type scheme is reused
         unchanged, so the dictionary parameter that becomes dead is left in
         place and is dropped by the downstream [dearg] pass — which is why the
         phase order is specialize -> dearg -> betared;
      3. redirect the call site to [f$specN x1 .. xn].

    The reductions that expose then discard the plumbing:

      - δ:  [f D]  δ-unfolds [f] to its body [λdict. body], then
      - β:  β-reduces to [body[dict := D]], which is *exactly* [f$specN]'s body,
            so [eval (f D) = eval (f$specN)];
      - ι:  [match D with C xs => br end] with [D = C a..] projects the method
            ([iota_red]); firing ι here is "read a field out of a known
            dictionary".  ([EBeta]'s plain [betared] does β but never ι, and
            [EInlining] inlines named constants uniformly rather than
            specializing a shared function per call site — so this pass
            subsumes neither.)

    Specializations are memoised by the key [(callee, dicts)] and the whole
    saturation is bounded by [specialize_fuel]; the loop re-scans each freshly
    emitted body, and [redirect] is then applied to the generated bodies as
    well as the original environment, so a chained call inside a generated body
    (a specialized body that itself passes a dictionary to another constant) is
    rewritten to the emitted [g$specM] rather than left pointing at the
    original callee.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    VERIFICATION STRUCTURE.

    [eval] is defined on *untyped* [EAst] via [trans_env].  The typed transform
    [specialize_program_typed] therefore does all of its analysis on the
    translated environment [trans_env Σ] and differs from the purely-untyped
    driver [drive_untyped] only in the [box_type] data that [trans_env] erases:

      * [specialize_commutes] proves that erasing the typed result equals
        running [drive_untyped] on the erased input, i.e.

            trans_env (specialize_program_typed Σ t)  =  drive_untyped (trans_env Σ) t.

        It is proved by [Qed] and reduces every semantic/wellformedness
        question about the *typed* pass to the corresponding question about the
        untyped core, with no blanket trust over the typed layer.
      * [typed_specialize_wf] (wellformedness preservation) and
        [typed_specialize_pres] (semantics preservation) are each proved by
        [Qed], modulo one residual about the untyped core,
        [untyped_drive_correct], which packages the δ/β/ι eval-simulation.
        This residual is the same obligation MetaRocq leaves axiomatized for
        the analogous optional passes ([EBeta.trust_betared_pres] /
        [EBeta.trust_betared_wf], [EInlining]); it is scoped to the untyped
        reducer rather than trusting the typed transform wholesale.

    The typed-specific reasoning (the [trans_env] commutation and the reduction
    of both preservation properties to the untyped core) is machine-checked;
    [Print Assumptions typed_specialize_pres] at the bottom lists exactly
    [untyped_drive_correct].  The untyped δ/β/ι simulation itself is the stated
    residual axiom.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PIPELINE PLACEMENT (typed pipeline, before Rust/Elm).
    [specialize_program_typed] is an optional phase for the typed extraction
    pipeline (Typed/Optimize.v / Typed/Extraction.v).  The phase order is
    specialize -> dearg -> betared: [dearg] removes the dead dictionary
    parameter this pass leaves, and [betared] mops up cascaded redexes.

(** ** Preservation for the typed pass (Qed, modulo the single residual). *)

(** (a) Wellformedness preservation. *)
Theorem typed_specialize_wf
  (efl : EEnvFlags) (wfl : WcbvFlags) (Σ : ExAst.global_env) (t : term) :
  wf_eprogram efl (trans_env Σ, t) ->
  wf_eprogram efl (typed_erase (specialize_program_typed Σ t)).
Proof.
  intros Hwf.
  rewrite specialize_commutes.
  exact (proj1 (untyped_drive_correct efl wfl (trans_env Σ) t Hwf)).
Qed.

(** (b) Semantics preservation.  Since [eval] is defined post-[trans_env], the
    statement is about the erased typed program; the specialized value is the
    locally-reduced original value (the [obseq] used by [EBeta]/[EInlining]). *)
Theorem typed_specialize_pres
  (efl : EEnvFlags) (wfl : WcbvFlags) (Σ : ExAst.global_env) (t v : term) :
  wf_eprogram efl (trans_env Σ, t) ->
  eval_eprogram wfl (trans_env Σ, t) v ->
  exists v', eval_eprogram wfl (typed_erase (specialize_program_typed Σ t)) v'
             /\ v' = specialize_instances v.
Proof.
  intros Hwf Hev.
  rewrite specialize_commutes.
  exact (proj2 (untyped_drive_correct efl wfl (trans_env Σ) t Hwf) v Hev).
Qed.

(** Assumptions of the top semantic-preservation lemma: exactly the one
    scoped residual [untyped_drive_correct] (plus ambient logical axioms, if
    any, from the imported libraries). *)
Print Assumptions typed_specialize_pres.

(** The commutation theorem itself carries no residual: its assumptions are
    only the ambient primitive-integer/string/float axiomatization of the
    imported MetaRocq libraries, never [untyped_drive_correct]. *)
Print Assumptions specialize_commutes.
